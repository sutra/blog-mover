HotSAX installation

This has been tested only with Java 2 J2SE jdk1.3. It should work in any 1.1 or later.

Make sure lib/hotsax.jar and lib/xerces.jar is in your CLASSPATH.  
You will need the Xerces XML library. You can get it from
http://xml.apache.org/xerces-j/index.html

If you want to run the test suite, you will need Pat Niemeyer's BeanShell.
http://www.beanshell.org
Edit the setclasspath shell script to indicate where your jar files are.

To run the test suite:
  cd ./test
  ./test.sh     - Unix shell script test harness. Sorry no Windows one yet.


The Java examples directory contains various examples from the user manual. See the
user manual (./doc/manual/userman.html) for usage instructions.

Build instructions are in the user manual. Download the buildtools.tar.gz file from
sourceforge. This contains the Ant jar files.

Documentation instructions are in the Colophon chapter of the user manual. You will need 
Xalan, the DocBook stylesheets and Xerces. You can get these from the doctools.tar.gz at 
sourceforge.
