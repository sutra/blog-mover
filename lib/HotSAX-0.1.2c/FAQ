Frequently Asked Questions about HotSAX.

(At this time, FAQ is a misnomer. So far only questions 1,2 and 10 
have ever actually been asked exactly once. But I usually read the FAQ 
to get a feeling for a project overall. Obviously, most of these I thought 
up myself. When I get some time, I'll actually answer them.

1. What is HotSAX?
	HotSAX is a small footprint, fast SAX2 compliant parser. It is non-validating. It differs from other
SAX parsers in that it can handle dirty HTML as well as XML or XHTML. 

	HotSAX is meant to be embedded in small memory devices like PDAs and cell phones, like the new Nokia
Java enabled mobile phone. You can create a "midlet" with HotSAX for example that scrapes stock quotes for you.

	You can use HotSAX in many environments from large to small. It is helpful in content management, personal
organizers, building web agents or Internet spiders.
 

2. Why did you call it that?
	Several people accused me of just creating a cutesy name to get it recognized. I plead the fifth. The 
actual name comes from the practice of naming HTML related tools with Hot prepended. E.g. HotMetal - the HTMl
editor, HotMail - the HTML mail app. 

   HotSAX is the first HTML-aware SAX parser I know of.

4.  If HotSAX is a SAX parser, why do you still need xerces.jar?
	Xerces.jar is needed to supply the various org.xml.sax.* interface definitions. It is also useful in that
it contains a stub DefaultHandler and a XMLReaderFactory. Eventually, as we near the 1.0 release, HotSAX will
be a standalone SAX jar file.

6.  How is HotSAX licensed?
	HotSAX is free software.
	HotSAX is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). The Lesser Public License
was originally named the Library General Public License, which allowed it to be linked to from proprietary
software. HotSAX can be included in any non-open source project. You can't extend it and distributing the
library without releasing the source code. For more explanation of this, please visit the Free Software 
Foundation's web site at http://www.fsf.org.

10. How can I contact the HotSAX developers if I have a question?
	You can mail me directly at ulysees2001@yahoo,com.

	Or you can contact any of the team members from the SourceForge project page.
